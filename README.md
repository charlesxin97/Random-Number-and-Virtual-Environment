# Random number generator
# Brief Intro
A random number generation and visualization project.

'Script 1' generate 1000 random number valued between 1-100.

'Script 2' did a calculation based on the result of script 1 and get another 1000 number. 

'Script 3' visualizes the result using result from 1 as x-axis and result from 2 as y-axis.

'/Output' folder contains output result as Json files and one visualized image for script 3 as well.

'script.ipynb' contains visualizations, can be run by Jupyter notebook and Binder.

# Environment requirement
"Environment Dependencies" lists all packages needed to run those scripts, the following steps lists all job to be done to create the environment.

1. create a virtual environment using virtualenv, name it as "dsci560H4"
2. move into the virtual environment folder and go to /scripts folder, run activate.bat to start the environment
3. install need package with: pip install jupyter, pip install json, pip install random
4. excute python scripts, should see the following screen for running script1.
